1. Make the app fully cover the page (with a background image).
example: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/

2. Add a fully covering carrousel for selection of playlists, 
with to the side the corresponding playlist items.
example: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/#with-captions

3. Animations to Randomization (Could be a small spring when result is there)
with build up to actual randomize

4. Simpler interface, with minimal distractions (no nav bar)
